## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The site was built using semantic HTML and Flexbox CSS and contains a small amount of JavaScript for the menu interaction for navigating around the site. The menu was more for mobile users but I found it might be helpful for others as well.

## Optimizations

I know there are better ways to lay out and scale the images on this site. I made this site before my portfolio site, which you'll see is where I learned to use different image sizes depending on viewport sizes. But decided to leave this as a more simple attempt; get the project up and working.
I'd like to make newer sites that use the mentioned best practice of scaling images vs rewriting this site, so that's why I haven't changed it.


## Lessons Learned: 

Flexbox seemed easy to use when playing with Flexbox Froggy and flexbox zombies, but when it comes to real-world usage I feel as if there are too many potential situations that you just need to code to learn.
There seems to always be something that can be done better but I guess that's what an entry-level engineer needs to learn.
